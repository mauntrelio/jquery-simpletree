# Simple Tree jQuery

Yet another jQuery treeview plugin to display nested UL as nice trees.

This plugin is based on a script and CSS for simple unobtrusive javascript treeview developed by Krijn Hoetmer:

Adapted as a jQuery plugin by Maurizio Manetti.

# TODO

- complete package json file and publish plugin to npm
- provide methods to collapse all and expand all
- provide method to "destroy" treeview
- provide more options (e.g.: start collapsed / start expanded)
- more examples
- themes
